                <h4>KOSOVA?</h4>
                <hr>
                Kosovo is a state in the Southeast Europe.
                It lies at the center of the Balkans,
                occupying an area of 10.887 km2 with a 
                population about 2 million. It is bordered 
                by Serbia to the north and east, North Macedonia
                 to the southeast, Albania to the southwest, 
                 and Montenegro to the west. Pristina is the capital and 
                 the largest city at the same time. 
                 Before getting into knowing more about Kosovo, 
                 let’s answer some of the main questions about 
                 this young country.

                <h4>WHAT IS THE MAIN LANGUAGE?</h4>
                <hr>
                -Albanian is the official language of Kosovo.
                According to the 2008 constitution, 
                Turkish, Serbian,Bosnian, and Romanians 
                have official status as relevant 
                municipalities. The Albanian spoken in 
                Kosovo is a subvariety of the Gheg dialect, 
                it is commonly known as ''Kosovarçe''.

                    <h4>WHAT ARE THE RELATIONS BETWEEN TURKEY AND KOSOVA</h4>
                    <hr>
                    The relations between two states; Kosovo and Turkey are friendly 
                and close, due to the Albanian population of Turkey 
                maintaining close links with Albanians of the Balkans 
                and vice versa and also Turkey maintaining close 
                socio-political, cultural, economic and military 
                ties with Kosovo.Relations between Albanians and 
                Turkey date back from the arrival of the Ottomans 
                to the region in the 15th century. 
                The Albanian diaspora in Turkey was formed 
                during the Ottoman era and early years of 
                the Turkish republic. Now the ambasador is Mr.Çağrı Sakar.
